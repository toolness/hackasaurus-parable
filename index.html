<h1>The Parable of The Hackasaurus</h1>

<div class="drop-cap">O</div><p>nce upon a time there lived a clever girl named Sue who liked to make things. She knit hats and built robots to wear them. But she didn’t know anything about how the Web worked; it was as opaque as a television screen to her.</p>

<p>One day a giant dinosaur appeared as she was exploring the web.</p>

<div class="image-holder"><img id="hackasaur" src="images/hackasaur.jpg" alt="Picture of Hackasaur" draggable="false"></div>

<p>“I’m going to show you how to hack the web!”, the dinosaur told Sue.</p>

<p>“Hack?” Sue asked. “Isn’t that evil?”</p>

<p>“No!” said the dinosaur. “Hacking can be used for good or ill. It is about tinkering with things to change how they work. Good hackers improve them and make them work better, but bad hackers make them worse.”</p>

<p>“Wow!” said Sue. “I want to be a good hacker.”</p>

<p>“Ok, then, try on these <a id="bookmarklet" href="javascript:(function(){var%20script=document.createElement('script');script.src='https://secure.toolness.com/webxray/webxray.js';script.className='webxray';document.head.appendChild(script);})();">Web X-Ray Goggles</a> and we’ll get started!”</p>

<p class="needs-fixing">Sue wore the goggles the dinosaur gave her, and suddenly she could see and change how everything on the web was put together.</p>
